            Playing hockey was my first chapter, that lead to living my childhood dreams on
            many great teams, among incredible teammates and coaches. These 20 years made
            me who I am and shaped my character.

            Once compiling injuries set in, I embarked on Co-founding CropShop,
            a B2B marketplace for Chefs and Local Farmers.

            Two years later I am a striving full-stack engineer obsessed with coding.
            When not at my computer, you can find me cooking, golfing, hiking,
            or anything else outside with my girlfriend Audry and pup Roger.
